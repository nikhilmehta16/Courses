\subsection{The PARAM Sanganak}

Supercomputers perform millions of arithmetic operations per second \cite{supercomputers1982}.
IIT Kanpur signed an MoU with the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) for installing PARAM Sanganak in 2020.
The supercomputing facility has been established under the National Supercomputing Mission \cite{nsm}.
The $1.3$ Peta FLOPS ($10^{15}$ floating point operations per second) supercomputing facility was installed at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in October, 2020. 
Figure \ref{fig:param} shows some pictures taken during the installation of PARAM Sanganak \cite{paramsanganak}.
